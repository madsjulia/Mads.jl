This is because the maximum probability of failure is almost zero when the horizon of uncertainty is zero. The zero-horizon of uncertainty estimate also corresponds to the result obtained using a Bayesian decision analysis that does not account for non-probabilistic (information gap) uncertainties.\n\nOn the other hand, we are somewhat vulnerable to uncertain outcomes that deviate from our nominal case. The sharp rise in the maximum probability of failure for the 2025 and 2030 scenarios when the horizon (level) of uncertainty is approximately 0.25 (25%) indicates that, e.g., if the model is underestimating the actual concentrations at the site by 25%, the probability of failure could be quite high. Another possibility is that undesirable outcomes that appear unlikely with the nominal variance appear more likely with some another possible variance within a horizon of uncertainty of 0.25.\n\nHere we assume that the maximum acceptable probability of failure (vertical axis in the figure above) is equal to 0.05 (5%), and base our decision analysis on where each of the curves reaches 5% maximum probability of failure. In this case, the scenarios terminating the source in 2025 and 2030 produce similar robustness; i.e., if we are willing to wait until 2025, then we may as well wait until 2030. At this level of risk (5%), terminating the source in 2015 and 2020 provides additional robustness. However, it may not be enough to merit action in the short term.\n\nBased on the robustness of the model predictions the decision makers can decide the course of action. Their decision can also rely on (1) risk assessment (e.g., differences in the exposure times depending on when the source is terminated) and (2) financial constraints (e.g., costs associated with the source termination over different time frames).","category":"section"},{"location":"Examples/bigdt/source_termination/source_termination.html#Model","page":"Contaminant Source Remediation","title":"Model","text":"Analytical solution of groundwater contaminant transport assuming Fickian dispersion (coded in Mads.jl).

The physical interpretation of the extracted features is done a posteriori by subject-matter experts.\n\nIn contrast, supervised Machine Learning methods are trained based on large labeled datasets The labeling is performed a priori by subject-matter experts. The process of deep Machine Learning commonly includes both unsupervised and supervised techniques LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton 2015 where unsupervised Machine Learning are applied to facilitate the process of data labeling.\n\nThe integration of large datasets, powerful computational capabilities, and affordable data storage has resulted in the widespread use of Machine Learning in science, technology, and industry.\n\nRecently we have developed a novel unsupervised Machine Learning methods. The methods are based on Matrix/Tensor Decomposition (Factorization) coupled with sparsity and nonnegativity constraints.

The decomposition (factorization) of a given tensor \\(X\\) is typically performed by minimization of the Frobenius norm:\n\n$\n\n\\frac{1}{2} ||X-G \\otimes1 A1 \\otimes2 A2 \\ldots \\otimesn An ||_F^2 $\n\nwhere:\n\n\\(n\\) is the dimensionality of the tensor \\(X\\)\n\\(G\\) is a \"mixing\" core tensor\n\\(A1,A2,\\ldots,A_n\\) are \"feature” factors (in the form of vectors or matrices)\n\\(\\otimes\\) is a tensor product applied to fold-in factors \\(A1,A2,\\ldots,A_n\\)  in each of the tensor dimensions\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">     <img src=\"../../figures/tucker-paper.png\" alt=\"tucker\" height=\"320\"/> </div>\n\nThe product \\(G \\otimes1 A1 \\otimes2 A2 \\ldots \\otimesn An\\) is an estimate of \\(X\\) (\\(X_{est}\\)).\n\nThe reconstruction error \\(X - X_{est}\\) is expected to be random uncorrelated noise.\n\n\\(G\\) is a \\(n\\)-dimensional tensor with a size and a rank lower than the size and the rank of \\(X\\). The size of tensor \\(G\\) defines the number of extracted features (signals) in each of the tensor dimensions.\n\nThe factor matrices \\(A1,A2,\\ldots,An\\) represent the extracted features (signals) in each of the tensor dimensions. The number of matrix columns equals the number of features in the respective tensor dimensions (if there is only 1 column, the particular factor is a vector). The number of matrix rows in each factor (matrix) \\(Ai\\) equals the size of tensor X in the respective dimensions.\n\nThe elements of tensor \\(G\\) define how the features along each dimension (\\(A1,A2,\\ldots,A_n\\)) are mixed to represent the original tensor \\(X\\).\n\nThe Tensor Decomposition is commonly performed using Candecomp/Parafac (CP) or Tucker decomposition models.\n\nSome of the decomposition models can theoretically lead to unique solutions under specific, albeit rarely satisfied, noiseless conditions. When these conditions are not satisfied, additional minimization constraints can assist the factorization.\n\nA popular approach is to add sparsity and nonnegative constraints. Sparsity constraints on the elements of G reduce the number of features and their mixing (by having as many zero entries as possible). Nonnegativity enforces parts-based representation of the original data which also allows the Tensor Decomposition results for \\(G\\) and \\(A1,A2,\\ldots,A_n\\) to be easily interrelated Cichocki et al, 2009.\n\nAlgorithms called NMFk and NTFk for Matrix/Tensor Factorization (Decomposition) coupled with sparsity and nonnegativity constraints custom k-means clustering has been developed in Julia\n\nNMFk and NTFk codes will be available soon as open-source on GitHub.\n\nNMFk and NTFk use TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet, and MatLab.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: left\">     <img src=\"../../logos/nmfk-logo.png\" alt=\"nmfk logo\" height=\"120\"/>     <span style=\"float: right\">     <img src=\"../../logos/ntfk-logo.png\" alt=\"ntfk logo\" height=\"120\"/>     </span> </div>","category":"section"},{"location":"Examples/machine_learning/machine_learning.html#Research-Papers","page":"Examples","title":"Research Papers","text":"Vesselinov, V.V., Mudunuru, M., Karra, S., O'Malley, D., Alexandrov, B.S., Unsupervised Machine Learning Based on Non-Negative Tensor Factorization for Analyzing Reactive-Mixing, Journal of Computational Physics, 2018 (in review).

dimensionless time 5 o5 can get lower than expected).\n\nThe model robustness defines that things might get worse than expected (i.e., observation at dimensionless time 5 o5 can get higher than expected).\n\nBased on both the model opportuneness and model robustness, the last model is the most complex and can bring the most surprises. The first model is the simplest and produces the lower level of surprises.\n\nIn terms of model selection, the simplest model is the best. However, the alternative models (if they capture all the conceptual model uncertainties) represent how much things can get worse/better within the horizon of uncertainty.","category":"section"},{"location":"Modules/Mads.html#Mads.jl","page":"Mads.jl","title":"Mads.jl","text":"Mads.jl

The fields in the MADS problem dictionary that can be used to define the model coupling are:\n\nModel : execute a Julia function defined in an external input Julia file. The function should accept a parameter dictionary with all the model parameters as an input argument and should return an observation dictionary with all the model-predicted observations. MADS will execute the first function defined in the file.\nMADS model : create a Julia function based on an external input Julia file. The input file should contain a function that accepts as an argument the MADS problem dictionary. MADS will execute the first function defined in the file. This function should create a Julia function that will accept a parameter dictionary with all the model parameters as an input argument and will return an observation dictionary with all the model-predicted observations.\nJulia model : execute an internal Julia function that accepts a parameter dictionary with all the model parameters as an input argument and will return an observation dictionary with all the model predicted observations.\nJulia function : execute an internal Julia function that accepts a parameter vector with all the model parameters as an input argument and will return an observation vector with all the model predicted observations.\nCommand : execute an external UNIX command or script that will execute an external model.\nJulia command : execute a Julia script that will execute an external model. The Julia script is defined in an external Julia file. The input file should contain a function that accepts a parameter dictionary with all the model parameters as an input argument; MADS will execute the first function defined in the file. The Julia script should be capable to (1) execute the model (making a system call of an external model), (2) parse the model outputs, and (3) return an observation dictionary with model predictions.\n\nBoth Command and Julia command can use different approaches to pass model parameters to the external model.\n\nOnly Command uses different approaches to get back the model outputs.\n\nThe script defined under Julia command parses the model outputs using Julia.\n\nThe available options for writing model inputs and reading model outputs are as follows.\n\nOptions for writing model inputs:\n\nTemplates : template files for writing model input files as defined at http://madsjulia.github.io\nASCIIParameters : model parameters written in an ASCII file\nJLDParameters : model parameters written in a JLD file\nYAMLParameters : model parameters written in a YAML file\nJSONParameters : model parameters written in a JSON file\n\nOptions for reading model outputs:\n\nInstructions : instruction files for reading model output files as defined at http://madsjulia.github.io\nASCIIPredictions : model predictions read from an ASCII file\nJLDPredictions : model predictions read from a JLD file\nYAMLPredictions : model predictions read from a YAML file\nJSONPredictions : model predictions read from a JSON file\n\nReturns:\n\nMads function to execute a forward model simulation\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Modules/Mads.html#Mads.makemadsconditionalloglikelihood-Tuple{AbstractDict}","page":"Mads.jl","title":"Mads.makemadsconditionalloglikelihood","text":"Make a function to compute the conditional log-likelihood of the model parameters conditioned on the model predictions/observations.
