[MADS](http://madsjulia.github.io/Mads.jl) is an integrated high-performance/cloud-computing framework for data/model/decision analyses.

[MADS](http://madsjulia.github.io/Mads.jl) can be coupled with any existing numerical model or simulator, including machine learning algorithms and models.

[MADS](http://madsjulia.github.io/Mads.jl) can be applied to perform:

* Sensitivity Analysis
* Parameter Estimation
* Model Inversion and Calibration
* Uncertainty Quantification
* Model Selection and Averaging
* Model Reduction and Surrogate Modeling
* Decision Analysis and Support

[MADS](http://madsjulia.github.io/Mads.jl) analyses utilize adaptive rules and techniques which allow the analyses to be performed efficiently with minimum user input.
