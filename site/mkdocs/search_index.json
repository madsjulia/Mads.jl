On the other hand, we are somewhat vulnerable to uncertain outcomes that deviate from our nominal case.\nThe sharp rise in the maximum probability of failure for the 2025 and 2030 scenarios when the horizon (level) of uncertainty is approximately 0.25 (25%) indicates that, e.g., if the model is underestimating the actual concentrations at the site by 25%, the probability of failure could be quite high.\nAnother possibility is that undesirable outcomes that appear unlikely with the nominal variance appear more likely with some another possible variance within a horizon of uncertainty of 0.25.  Here we assume that the maximum acceptable probability of failure (vertical axis in the figure above) is equal to 0.05 (5%), and base our decision analysis on where each of the curves reaches 5% maximum probability of failure.\nIn this case, the scenarios terminating the source in 2025 and 2030 produce similar robustness; i.e., if we are willing to wait until 2025, then we may as well wait until 2030.\nAt this level of risk (5%), terminating the source in 2015 and 2020 provides additional robustness.\nHowever, it may not be enough to merit action in the short term.  Based on the robustness of the model predictions the decision makers can decide the course of action.\nTheir decision can also rely on\n(1) risk assessment (e.g., differences in the exposure times depending on when the source is terminated) and\n(2) financial constraints (e.g., costs associated with the source termination over different time frames).",

The model coupling is defined in the MADS problem dictionary. The expectations is that for a given set of model inputs, the model will produce a model output that will be provided to MADS. The fields in the MADS problem dictionary that can be used to define the model coupling are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\n : execute a Julia function defined in an input Julia file. The function that should accept a \nparameter\n dictionary with all the model parameters as an input argument and should return an \nobservation\n dictionary with all the model predicted observations. MADS will execute the first function defined in the file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMADS model\n : create a Julia function based on an input Julia file. The input file should contain a function that accepts as an argument the MADS problem dictionary. MADS will execute the first function defined in the file. This function should a create a Julia function that will accept a \nparameter\n dictionary with all the model parameters as an input argument and will return an \nobservation\n dictionary with all the model predicted observations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulia model\n : execute an internal Julia function that accepts a \nparameter\n dictionary with all the model parameters as an input argument and will return an \nobservation\n dictionary with all the model predicted observations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\n : execute an external UNIX command or script that will execute an external model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulia command\n : execute a Julia script that will execute an external model. The Julia script is defined in an input Julia file. The input file should contain a function that accepts as an argument the MADS problem dictionary; MADS will execute the first function defined in the file. The Julia script should be capable to (1) execute the model (making a system call of an external model), (2) parse the model outputs, (3) return an \nobservation\n dictionary with model predictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth \nCommand\n and \nJulia command\n can use different approaches to pass model parameters to the external model.\n\n\nOnly \nCommand\n uses different approaches to get back the model outputs. The script defined under \nJulia command\n parses the model outputs using Julia.\n\n\nThe available options for writing model inputs and reading model outputs are as follows.\n\n\nOptions for writing

The function that should accept a  parameter  dictionary with all the model parameters as an input argument and should return an  observation  dictionary with all the model predicted observations. MADS will execute the first function defined in the file.    MADS model  : create a Julia function based on an input Julia file. The input file should contain a function that accepts as an argument the MADS problem dictionary. MADS will execute the first function defined in the file. This function should a create a Julia function that will accept a  parameter  dictionary with all the model parameters as an input argument and will return an  observation  dictionary with all the model predicted observations.    Julia model  : execute an internal Julia function that accepts a  parameter  dictionary with all the model parameters as an input argument and will return an  observation  dictionary with all the model predicted observations.    Command  : execute an external UNIX command or script that will execute an external model.    Julia command  : execute a Julia script that will execute an external model. The Julia script is defined in an input Julia file. The input file should contain a function that accepts as an argument the MADS problem dictionary; MADS will execute the first function defined in the file. The Julia script should be capable to (1) execute the model (making a system call of an external model), (2) parse the model outputs, (3) return an  observation  dictionary with model predictions.    Both  Command  and  Julia command  can use different approaches to pass model parameters to the external model.  Only  Command  uses different approaches to get back the model outputs. The script defined under  Julia command  parses the model outputs using Julia.  The available options for writing model inputs and reading model outputs are as follows.  Options for writing model inputs:   Templates  : template files for writing model input files as defined at http://mads.lanl.gov  ASCIIParameters  : model parameters written in a ASCII file  JLDParameters  : model parameters written in a JLD file  YAMLParameters  : model parameters written in a YAML file  JSONParameters  : model parameters written in a JSON file   Options for reading model outputs:   Instructions  : instruction files for reading model output files as defined at http://mads.lanl.gov  ASCIIPredictions  : model predictions read from a ASCII file  JLDPredictions  : model predictions read from a JLD file  YAMLPredictions  : model predictions read from a YAML file  JSONPredictions  : model predictions read from a JSON file   source:  Mads/src/MadsFunc.jl:49",
